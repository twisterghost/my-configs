My Configs
==========

An annotated collection of my configuration files so that I can easily plop them
on new boxes when needed. Feel free to fork, or even make pull requests if you
are deeply offended by something I have in my configurations.

The primary functionality of this repo is to serve as a master copy of my files.
Sourcing `bash-profile.sh` from a `.bash_profile` will load up all of my usual
functions and alises dynamically from `scripts/`, as well as ensure that the
files are up to date with this repo upon startup or re-sourcing.
