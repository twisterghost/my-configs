My Configs
==========

An annotated collection of my configuration files so that I can easily plop them
on new boxes when needed. Feel free to fork, or even make pull requests if you
are deeply offended by something I have in my configurations.

The primary functionality of this repo is to serve as a master copy of my files.
Sourcing `bash-profile.sh` from a `.bash_profile` will load up all of my usual
functions and alises dynamically from `scripts/`.

I am a cross-platform user, so these scripts have been kept such that they work
on OSX and GNU/Linux - specifically Ubuntu. Additionally, there is a file for
getting Windows installation to a solid starting point.
